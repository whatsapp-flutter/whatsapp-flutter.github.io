## Components of Interactive List Messages

### Sections

A section is a grouping of related items. Each section has a title and contains multiple rows. Sections help organize the content in a logical way for the user.

```js
"sections": [{
    "title": "Birds",
    "rows": [...]
}]
```

### Title

The title of a section is a string that describes the content or theme of that section. It provides context to the user about the type of items they can expect within that section.

```js
"title": "Birds"
```

### Rows

Rows are individual items within a section. Each row represents a single interactive element that the user can select. A row contains an id, title, and description.

```js
"rows": [{
    "id": "1001",
    "title": "Peacock",
    "description": "Lifespan: 15 years"
}]
```

- #### ID

The id is a unique identifier for each row. It is used to distinguish between different rows within the same or different sections. This id is usually a string.

- #### Title

The title of a row is a string that provides the main information about that row. It is typically a short, descriptive name or label for the item.

- #### Description

The description of a row is a string that provides additional details about the item. This can include information such as characteristics, lifespan, or any other relevant data.
