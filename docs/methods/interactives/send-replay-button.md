## headerInteractive

Header is part of message, which will be shown in top of message.

Supports the following types:

- document
- image
- text
- video

You can provide map values of given types, and use `media_id` or `link`.

### Using Media ID

```js
{
  "type": "image",
  "image": {
    "to": "media_id"
  }
}
```

### Using Link

```js
{
  "type": "image",
  "image": {
    "link": "https://www.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/so-you-want-to-breed-dogs-500x500.jpg"
  }
}
```

## interactiveReplyButtons

- `type` : The type field specifies the kind of interactive element. For reply buttons, the type is always set to "reply".
- `replay`: The reply object contains the id and title of the button. This is the actual content of the button that the user sees and interacts with.
  - `Id` : The id is a unique identifier for each button. It is used to distinguish between different buttons within the same or different messages. This id is usually a string.
  - `title` :The title is the text that appears on the button. It is a short, descriptive label that indicates the action that will be taken when the button is pressed.
